In group-living animals, the recognition of group members often has important fitness consequences. This is particularly true for animals that perform cooperative or altruistic behaviour towards group members. This is why it is surprising that some termite species can be found in mixed groups comprising multiple colonies that have fused together to act as one large group.
We were interested in why some groups might fuse together and what predictors there might be for when this happens. In particular, there might some mechanistic constraints that allow the fusion of groups – in other words, individuals might just not realise that they’re interacting with individuals from a different group. This might be particularly relevant for single-piece nesting termites, which live in (and eat) the same piece of wood for the entire lifetime of the colony because the environment can have a big impact on potential recognition cues (chemicals on the surface of the animals or gut microbiome, for example).">

<p>In group-living animals, the recognition of group members often has important fitness consequences. This is particularly true for animals that perform cooperative or altruistic behaviour towards group members. This is why it is surprising that some termite species can be found in mixed groups comprising multiple colonies that have fused together to act as one large group.</p>
<p>We were interested in why some groups might fuse together and what predictors there might be for when this happens. In particular, there might some mechanistic constraints that allow the fusion of groups – in other words, individuals might just not realise that they’re interacting with individuals from a different group. This might be particularly relevant for single-piece nesting termites, which live in (and eat) the same piece of wood for the entire lifetime of the colony because the environment can have a big impact on potential recognition cues (chemicals on the surface of the animals or gut microbiome, for example).</p>
<p>If it is the case that these termites are constrained by their environment, then we would expect that individuals from a completely different environment would elicit a different response to those raised in a similar environment. We therefore ran an experiment in which we introduced individuals to termites from other colonies who were raised either on the same type of wood, or a different type.</p>
<p>We found that, while termites clearly responded differently to non-groupmates than they did groupmates, there was no difference in response to the non-groupmates raised in different environments.</p>
<p>This shows that these termites’ groupmate recognition is not constrained by the shared environment that fusing groups often have. It also shows that there are no environmentally driven neighbour-stranger effects in this species, meaning that they respond to all newcomers in the same way. This is interesting because it shows that fusion is probably not an accident driven by failed recognition, which means it could be a phenomenon that has important fitness consequences for the individuals and colonies involved.</p>
