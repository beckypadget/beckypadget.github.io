# The purpose of theoretical modelling in ecology and evolution

Theoretical models fall into two broad categories: mechanistic models that aim to accurately and precisely describe a specific system (e.g., a cell) and predict perturbations to specific systems; and non-mechanistic (`phenomenological') explanatory models which broadly describe a part of many systems and aim to qualitatively describe them in order to explain what might be going on. These two broad approaches have very different aims and thus very different methods are appropriate to develop and test the output of these models.

Mechanistic predictive models are designed to describe a system very closely. This allows us to model what happens when perturbations push the system out of equilibrium. These models are important in the physical sciences, including physical aspects of the life sciences. In these fields, the relationships between events typically (but obviously not always) are quantitatively deterministic, or at least more predictable because they often follow the laws of physics -- for example, in the absence of active transport, the rate at which molecules move down a concentration gradient is predictable given knowledge of the system. This does not make these models easier to develop because more details might be required in order to achieve model behaviour that reflects reality. The functions and parameters in these models can be derived from data about these systems and the aim is that the model reflects reality as closely as possible. Iteratively testing and developing these models in conjunction with data is therefore very important.

Explanatory models are a bit more abstract. With these models, we aim to develop a hypothesis for how a system (or, more likely, part of a system) works. Because these models aim to explain why, not how, a system works, their functions do not need to be based on data (in fact, as we'll see later on, it might be better if they're not). We also do not expect these models to match data quantitatively. This is because our model describes many different systems which might act on vastly different scales (for example, learning over the lifetime of an individual and evolution over many generations), or with different types of response (for example, we might measure cooperative behaviour in one system as time, whereas in another it might make more sense to measure it in volume of a particular item that is the object of the cooperative behaviour) -- the key predictions from these models are therefore qualitative (i.e., cooperation will go up or down with a particular parameter). It is this type of model that will be the focus of the rest of this paper -- any reference to 'models' or 'theoretical models' etc after this section, I refer to these explanatory models.

There are any number of sub-divisions within both of these categories. The explanatory models, for example, can be split into mathematical models, which rely on analytically tractable functions to make their predictions; and agent-based or other simulation-based models, which can model much more complex relationships. But both of these types of model aim to uncover something about why a natural system looks the way it does by proposing a potential mathematical mechanism underpinning the outcome. Game theoretic models, adaptive dynamics models, state-dependent models all fit into this category of hypothesis-formalising model and while some types of models lend themselves to mathematical or agent-based methods more, a variety of methods can be used fro model types.
