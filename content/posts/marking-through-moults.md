# A method for individually marking insects

When conducting behavioural experiments, it can be useful to be able to identify individuals. One way to individually mark animals is to use ‘visible implant elastomer’, which is essentially a small plastic tattoo that sits below the surface of animals’ skin. It comes in different colours and can be applied in different formations to uniquely mark many animals.

One set of animals that is particularly hard to mark during experiments is insects because surface dyes can affect important olfactory cues and change behaviour. In this experiment, we tested whether visible implant elastomer would be appropriate for marking insects. Specifically, we tested the method in termites (_Zootermopsis angusticollis_).

We gave each termite a single mark, then assayed their survival and behaviour over the course of 14 weeks. We found that marked termites survived just as well as the unmarked termites, but there were some small changes in behaviour. Specifically, marked termites performed slightly less allogrooming and trophallaxis than the un-marked termites. The effect sizes for these differences were very small.

We suggest that visible implant elastomer could be useful for individually marking insects such as termites, but that researchers should be cautious when carrying out behavioural assays on marked individuals.
